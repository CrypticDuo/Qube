simply-toast
===
Simple toast messages for jQuery (and friends)

* * *

Usage instructions and samples on http://ericprieto.com/freebie/simply-toast/

* * *

All css styles were extracted from bootstrap, so, if you already use bootstrap, you don't need simply-toast.css

* * *

If anybody has interest on a jquery-less version, just open an issue and I'll look into that.

Based on http://ifightcrime.github.io/bootstrap-growl, but unlike bootstrapGrowl, Simply Toast does not need bootstrap.js nor bootstrap.css.
